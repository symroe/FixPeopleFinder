This is a Google Chrome extension that fixes a few annoying things about [People Finder](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/peoplefinder.).

Currently it:

* Looks for a search result containing the exact text in the query, and makes that the top result (often the exact match is > 5 results down)
* Removes the barrier that makes saving images harder
* Removes the stretching of images so they are the correct size.

You can build this yourself, or if you trust me you can just download the included `FixPeopleFinder.crx` and drag it in to your browser window to install.
